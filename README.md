## Report a bug
...or _issue_ if you will.

A _bug_ is an _unexpected behaviour_ -- usually erroneous -- of a software component or in a data package.
Many bugs are evident from either the user perspective and developer's -- for instance, _"the app crashes when the username/password are tried blank"_ --, **but** many other bugs are not _that_ evident.

It is then important to _state_ what is/was the _expected behaviour_ when reporting a bug -- or any issue.

Together with the expectations, _error messages_ -- or any erroneous output -- help _a lot_ (actually, that is effectively the reason they exist: to inform what is the problem the software found at that moment!).

Also, since _software_ is something that evolves (more or less) quickly, it goes a long way informing the _version_ you're experiencing the problem(s).

Finally, and very important actually if you're interesting in having your issue addressed as best/fast as possible: _give an example_ of what you were doing or what were the input values you gave. In other, clearer words: if the person reading your _bug report_ wants to _reproduce_ your case, what should (s)he do? 

Summary:
* Express what happened, and 
  * state what you were/are _expecting_ to happen;
* Provide any error _messages_ you have about it,
  * printscreen or terminal text, anything is better then nothing;
* Provide the software/data version in use;
* Give information to allow the issue/bug to be reproducible.
